# AUTH48 for RFC-to-be 9380 (draft-irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve-16)
This repository is for managing document updates for RFC-to-be 9345 during AUTH48. 

Please see the [License](https://github.com/rfc-editor/draft-irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve/blob/master/LICENSE.md). The [IETF Note Well](https://github.com/rfc-editor/draft-irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve/blob/master/note-well.md) applies.

GitHub features that will be used:
* Issue tracking
* Pull requests
* @mentions

Authors, AD, WG chairs, and document shepherd, please ensure that your GitHub notification settings are set such that you can participate promptly in discussions of issues and pull requests. For more information, please see [Configuring notifications](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications).

This document is being edited in kramdown-rfc markdown.  Once the content is stable, the markdown will be converted to RFCXML and formatted as an RFC.  Your final approval means you approve both the content and format.

## Issue Tracking
The initial version of draft-irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve.md is the same as what was approved for publication. 

The current version of draft-irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve.md has been edited minimally for correctness. See PRs [#X](https://github.com/rfc-editor/draft-irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve/pull/X) and [#X](https://github.com/rfc-editor/draft-irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve/pull/X).

The RFC Production Center's additional suggested updates have been added as PRs.  Open-ended questions and FYIs have been added as issues.  Please approve the PRs or propose alternate updates.  For the issues, provide your answers in the comments or add PRs to address them.  Use the issue labels to indicate their status:
* rfced - initial label of RFC Editor questions and FYIs (keep this label if the issue is still active).
* question - a follow-up question has been added to the issue discussion. Use @mention to identify the participant who should answer. 
* AD approval required - the resolution of the issue requires the AD to review and approve the change.
* rfced-ready - the RFC Editor can update the document and/or close the issue based on the issue discussion.

Feel free to add new issues and PRs for new edits and questions. 

The RPC Editor will close an issue when it has been addressed either by accepting a pull request or simply closing the issue if no changes are needed. 

## Pull Requests
If you would like to submit changes, please create a pull request and identify one or more issues that the pull request closes in the comments. 

If the RPC editor creates the PR, the editor expects feedback from the reviewer before merging the PR. 

Once the content of the .md file is stable and an XML file has been created, the following files will also be provided:
* [https://www.rfc-editor.org/authors/rfc9380.html](https://www.rfc-editor.org/authors/rfc9380.html)
* [https://www.rfc-editor.org/authors/rfc9380.pdf](https://www.rfc-editor.org/authors/rfc9380.pdf)
